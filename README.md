# Medicine Storage Temperature Tracker

## I. Project Idea
**1. Project Idea**
- A monitoring and control system for the warehouse environment to ensure that medicines and pharmaceuticals are always stored at safe temperature conditions. The system uses a temperature sensor to measure the environment's temperature in the warehouse and allows the control of devices such as lights, alarms, and fans through remote control and mobile phone apps.
- When the temperature exceeds the allowed limit, the system will:

Automatically alert with warning lights and alarms.

Automatically turn on the fan to cool down the warehouse.
